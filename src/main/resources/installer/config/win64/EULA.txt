licenses to distribute certain Third Party software. As a condition
of those licenses, Facilia is required to distribute the software
to Licensee subject to specific terms and conditions, which may be
different from or additional to those contained herein for Facilia'
Programs. Licensee understands and agrees that acceptance of this
Agreement also confirms Licensee's acceptance of the applicable
provisions for use, including the restrictions on use, of such Third
Party software. The at delivery current applicable provisions may be
viewed on the distribution CD under the file folder named libraries.
Licensee may contact Facilia to obtain the current applicable provisions.
Licensee's breach of the applicable provisions of any Third Party's license
terms shall also be considered a material breach of this Agreement.

8. SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICE. During any paid Software Maintenance
Service term, if applicable, Facilia shall provide Software
Maintenance Service for the licensed Programs which consists of:
delivering subsequent releases of the Programs, if any, that are not
charged for separately; exerting reasonable efforts to both (a)
provide, within a reasonable time, workarounds for any material
programming errors in the current release of the Programs that are
directly attributable to Facilia, and (b) correct such errors in
the next available release, provided Licensee provides Facilia with
sufficient information to identify the errors. During this same paid
Software Maintenance Service term, Licensee shall also be entitled to
receive technical support for the current release. Technical support
means assistance by telephone, fax, and electronic mail with the
installation and/or use of the then-current release of the licensed
Programs, including all available bug fixes and patches, and their
interaction with supported hardware and operating systems
("Platforms"). Facilia reserves the option to discontinue, in
whole or in part, and at any time, offering Software Maintenance
Service and/or technical support for any Program or Platform.

9. LICENSE DURATION ("TERM"). This Agreement shall continue until the
earlier of (a) termination by Facilia or Licensee as provided
below, or (b) such time as there are no Programs being licensed to
Licensee hereunder.

9.1. For Annual Licenses: Licensee understands and agrees that each
Annual License will expire automatically immediately after its
corresponding one (1) year period, unless Licensee renews its
License by remitting the then-current annual License fee.
Licensee understands that the Programs will stop operating
unless Licensee pays the License fee and is provided new annual
passcodes. Licensee understands and agrees that the Software
Maintenance Service for each Annual License will terminate
automatically upon expiration of the Annual License Term.

9.2. For Term Licenses: Licensee understands and agrees that each
Term License will expire automatically immediately after the
corresponding period of the term licensed, unless Licensee
renews its License by remitting the then-current term License
Fee. Licensee understands that the Programs will stop operating
unless Licensee pays the license fee and is provided new term
passcodes. Licensee understands and agrees that the Software
Maintenance Service for each Term License will terminate
automatically upon expiration of the License Term.

9.3. For Perpetual Licenses: Licensee shall have the right to use
the Programs indefinitely, subject to the termination provisions
in this Agreement. Licensee understands and agrees that the
Software Maintenance Service for each Perpetual License will
terminate automatically upon expiration of the initial Software
Maintenance Service term included with the acquisition of the
License. Thereafter, the Software Maintenance Service term may
be renewed for any Program, at the then-current price, and for
the then-applicable term, as long as Facilia offers such
Software Maintenance Service for such Program.

9.4. For Student Licenses: The Student License term expires
automatically immediately after the duration of Licensee's
enrollment in a degree-granting institution or participation in
a continuing education program of a degree-granting institution.
Software Maintenance Service is not available for Student
Licenses.

10. TERMINATION. Facilia may terminate this Agreement and all Licenses
granted hereunder by written notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches
any material term of this License, including failure to pay any
License fees due, and Licensee has not cured such breach within sixty
(60) days of written notification. Facilia may immediately
terminate upon notice this Agreement and all Licenses granted
hereunder should Licensee breach the terms and conditions of Sections
3, 4, and/or 10. Licensee may terminate this License at any time,
for any reason. Licensee shall not be entitled to any refund if this
License is terminated, except for License fees paid for any Programs
for which the Acceptance Period has not expired at the time of
termination. Upon termination, Licensee shall promptly return all
but archival copies of the Programs in Licensee's possession or
control, or promptly provide written certification of their
destruction.

11. EXPORT CONTROL. The Programs may be subject to U.S. export control
laws or other (U.S. and non-U.S.) governmental export and import
laws and regulations. Notwithstanding any other term of this
Agreement or Third Party agreement, Licensee's rights under this
Agreement may not be exercised by Licensee or any Third Party in
violation of such laws and regulations, nor may this Agreement be
transferred to any party where doing so would result in such a
violation. The terms of any limitation on the use, transfer or
re-export of the Programs imposed by Facilia in any Destination
Control Statement or other document for the purpose of export
control shall prevail over any term in this Agreement. It shall be
Licensee's responsibility to comply with the latest United States or
other governmental export and import regulations.

12. FEDERAL ACQUISITION. This provision applies to all acquisitions of
the Programs and Documentation by, for, or through the federal
government of the United States. By accepting delivery of the
Programs or Documentation, the government hereby agrees that this
software or documentation qualifies as commercial computer software
or commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used
or defined in FAR 12.212, DFARS Part 227.72, and DFARS 252.227-7014.
Accordingly, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and only
those rights specified in this Agreement, shall pertain to and
govern the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance,
display, and disclosure of the Programs and Documentation by the
federal government (or other entity acquiring for or through the
federal government) and shall supersede any conflicting contractual
terms or conditions. If this License fails to meet the government's
needs or is inconsistent in any respect with federal procurement
law, the government agrees to return the Programs and Documentation,
unused, to Facilia.

13. FOR EUROPEAN UNION LICENSEES ONLY. Any contractual provisions of
this Agreement contrary to laws implemented under Article 6 of
Appendix V of the European Union Software Directive or to the
exceptions provided for in Article 5(2) and (3) of such Appendix
shall be null and void solely to the extent decompiling,
disassembling, or otherwise reverse-engineering of the Programs is
necessary to enable the Licensee to create an independent program
that is interoperable with the Programs or any other permitted
objectives specified by such laws implemented under such directive
(collectively, the "Permitted Objectives"), provided that any such
information gained is used solely for such Permitted Objectives.

14. TAXES, DUTIES, CUSTOMS. Absent appropriate exemption certificates
or other conclusive proof of tax exempt status, Licensee shall pay
all applicable sales, use, excise, value-added, and other taxes,
duties, levies, assessments, and governmental charges payable in
connection with this Agreement or the Licenses granted hereunder,
excluding taxes based on or measured by Facilia' income, for which
Facilia shall be solely responsible.

15. ASSIGNMENT. Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this
Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent
of Facilia. In the case of any permitted assignment or transfer
of or under this Agreement, this Agreement or the relevant
provisions shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the
successors, executors, heirs, representatives, administrators and
assigns of the parties hereto. Facilia may charge Licensee an
administrative fee for any permitted assignment.

16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The Programs should not be relied on as
the sole basis to solve a problem or implement a design whose
incorrect solution or implementation could result in injury to
person or property. If a Program is employed in such a manner, it
is at the Licensee's own risk and Facilia and its licensors
explicitly disclaim all liability for such misuse to the extent
allowed by law. Facilia' and Facilia' Licensors' liability for
death or personal injury resulting from negligence or for any other
matter in relation to which liability by law cannot be excluded or
limited shall not be excluded or limited. Except as aforesaid, (a)
any other liability of Facilia and its Licensors (whether in
relation to breach of contract, negligence or otherwise) shall not
in total exceed the amount paid to Facilia under this Agreement in
the twelve month period preceding the claim in question, for the
Program with respect to which the liability in question arises; and
(b) Facilia and its Licensors shall have no liability for any
indirect or consequential loss (whether foreseeable or otherwise and
including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of opportunity,
and loss of use of any computer hardware or software). Some states
do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not
apply to Licensee.

17. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES. Facilia warrants that
Facilia, on its own behalf or through its Licensors, has the right
to grant the License rights hereunder. Facilia warrants that the
physical media provided shall be free from defects in material and
workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days from delivery, or it
will be replaced by Facilia at no cost to Licensee. Facilia
further warrants, for a period of one (1) year from delivery or for
the term of the License, whichever is less, that each copy of each
Program will conform in all material respects to the description of
such Program's operation in the Documentation. In the event that a
Program does not operate as warranted, Licensee's exclusive remedy
and Facilia' sole liability under this warranty shall be the
correction or workaround by Facilia of major defects within a
reasonable time. Should such correction or workaround be
impractical, Facilia may, at its option, terminate the relevant
License and refund the initial License fee paid to Facilia for
such Program. All requests for warranty assistance should be
directed to Facilia, Gustavslundsvägen 151 A, SE-167 51, Bromma, Sweden.

18. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Except for warranties expressly set forth
in Section 16 of this Agreement (or as implied by law where the law
provides that the particular terms implied cannot be excluded by
contract), any and all Programs, Documentation, and Software
Maintenance Services are delivered "as is" and Facilia makes and
the Licensee receives no additional express or implied warranties.
Facilia and its Licensors hereby expressly disclaim any and all
other conditions, warranties, or other terms of any kind or nature
concerning the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance
Services (including, without limitation, any with regard to
infringement, merchantability, quality, accuracy, or fitness for a
particular purpose or Licensee's purpose). Facilia also expressly
disclaims any warranties that may be implied from usage of trade,
course of dealing, or course of performance. Except for the express
warranties stated in Section 16 of this Agreement, the Programs,
Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services are provided with
all faults, and the entire risk of satisfactory quality,
performance, accuracy, and effort is with Licensee. Facilia does
not warrant that the Programs and Documentation will operate without
interruption or be error free. Some states and countries do not
allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the
above limitation may not apply to Licensee. The warranty in Section
16 gives Licensee specific legal rights and Licensee may also have
other rights which vary from state to state and country to country.
Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Programs and the
results obtained therefrom.

19. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION. This Agreement shall be interpreted,
enforced and construed and the rights of the parties hereunder
governed in all respects by the laws of Sweden, without regard to its
conflicts of law provisions, and both parties consent to the
jurisdiction of the courts located in Sweden and consent
to the service of process, pleadings and notices
in connection with any and all actions initiated in such
courts. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action
or proceeding shall be conclusive and binding and may be enforced in
any other jurisdiction. To the extent any governing law, treaty, or
regulation is in conflict with this Agreement, the conflicting terms
of this Agreement shall be superseded only to the extent necessary
by such law, treaty, or regulation. If any provision of this
Agreement shall be otherwise unlawful, void, or otherwise
unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum
extent permissible. In either case, the remainder of this Agreement
shall not be affected. The parties agree that the U.N. Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to
this Agreement. The parties further agree that the Uniform Computer
Information Transactions Act, or any version thereof, adopted by any
state, in any form ("UCITA"), shall not apply to this Agreement. To
the extent that UCITA is applicable, the parties agree to opt out of
the applicability of UCITA pursuant to the Opt-Out provision(s)
contained therein.

20. COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT RIGHTS. Licensee agrees to notify Facilia
promptly upon discovery of any failure to comply with one or more
Licenses granted under this Agreement, or any failure to comply with
any other material term of this Agreement. To confirm Licensee's
compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee
agrees to allow Facilia to audit Licensee's use of the Programs,
and to provide Facilia access to Licensee's facilities and
computer systems, and cooperation from Licensee's employees and
consultants, as reasonably requested by Facilia in order to
perform such audit, all during normal business hours, and after
reasonable prior notice from Facilia. If an audit discloses that
Licensee has failed to comply with one or more Licenses, and such
failure to comply could have in part or in whole been avoided by
Licensee having paid additional License fees to expand the scope of
the License or Licenses, then Licensee shall promptly pay Facilia
such Licensing fees (at Facilia' then current rates) and, if such
unpaid License fees exceed 5% of the License fees paid to Facilia
for the applicable Programs during the applicable period during
which such underpayment occurred, then Licensee shall, in addition
to paying the unpaid License fees, also reimburse Facilia the full
cost of such audit.

21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, and any applicable Addendum
thereto including any documents referenced therein are incorporated
herein by reference, and contain the entire understanding of the
parties and may not be modified or amended except by written
instrument, executed by authorized representatives of Facilia and
Licensee. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and
any purchase order executed by Licensee (whether executed before or
after this Agreement), this Agreement shall prevail.

provided the Programs are only accessible to, and operated by,
the Named User(s) for that License. Network installation is
prohibited. The locations of the standalone computers used by
the Named User to run the Programs are not limited; the
computers may be located at work, home, in a laboratory, or on a
laptop. Licensee may only designate one Licensed User access to
or use of the Programs under each Named User License. Licensee
may replace the Named User for a Program, whether temporarily or
not, no more than four (4) times per year. A Named User may run
multiple simultaneous Program sessions on not more than two (2)
separate processors, whether located in the same or different
computers.

Alternatively, for the Windows platform only, Licensee may
install the Programs on a single, designated, standalone
computer, provided the Programs are only operated from that
computer's console by only one individual at any given time (a
"Designated Computer" Installation Type). This Designated
Computer Installation Type is in lieu of the Standalone Named
User rights above, not in addition to those rights, and is
intended to accommodate a single Windows computer shared by
multiple users.

5.2. Network Named User. Programs may only be installed in a central
location on a single designated network server. Licensee must
run the FLEXnet license manager software provided with the

access and operate each Program. Licensee may re-edit the list
of Named Users in the Local License Options file and may replace
Named Users for a Program, whether temporarily or not, no more
than four (4) times per year, provided the number of Named Users
in the file never exceeds the number licensed per Program.
Portions of the Programs may be installed on individual
computers to accelerate startup times, as long as the
installations on the individual computers are controlled by the
license manager on the network server. A Named User may run
multiple simultaneous Program sessions on not more than two (2)
separate processors, whether located in the same or different
computers.

5.3. Network Concurrent User. The Programs may only be installed in
a central location on a single designated network server.
Licensee may have only as many Licensed Users simultaneously
operating a Program at any given time as the number of
Concurrent keys acquired for that Program, except in the case of
the Engine in which case the number of Program sessions running
at any one time is limited to the number of Engine workers
acquired. Portions of the Programs may be installed on
individual computers to accelerate startup times, as long as the
installations on the individual computers are controlled by the
license manager on the network server. Subject to the
foregoing, a Licensed User of the Concurrent License Option may
utilize any number of computers served by a single license
manager server provided that, before starting a Program session
on any computer, the Licensed User checks out a Concurrent key
from the license manager server for that computer, and that any
Concurrent Program sessions on each computer are not run on more
than two (2) separate processors on each computer. Licensees
of the Concurrent License Option are prohibited from providing
Program access to users located outside the country in which the
license manager server is installed unless Licensee has
contracted for global use. For the purposes of the Concurrent
License Option, all servers located in a member country of the
North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA") shall be
considered located in the same country as those of the other
NAFTA members, and all servers located in Iceland, Norway,
Switzerland, or any member country of the European Union ("EU")
shall be considered located in the same country.

licensed for each Program. Licensee is responsible for
ensuring that the total number of Designated Computers on
which each Program is installed and used does not exceed
the number licensed for each Program. This License Option
must be centrally administered and maintained. Licensee
shall be responsible for, and shall assign a central

licensed under the Classroom License Option are further
restricted to use in connection with on-campus computing
facilities that are used solely in support of classroom
instruction of students. Research use is not permitted.

5. INSTALLATION TYPES.

5.1. Standalone Named User. The Programs may only be installed and
operated on one or more individual, standalone computers,
provided the Programs are only accessible to, and operated by,
the Named User(s) for that License. Network installation is
prohibited. The locations of the standalone computers used by
the Named User to run the Programs are not limited; the
computers may be located at work, home, in a laboratory, or on a
laptop. Licensee may only designate one Licensed User access to
or use of the Programs under each Named User License. Licensee
may replace the Named User for a Program, whether temporarily or
not, no more than four (4) times per year. A Named User may run
multiple simultaneous Program sessions on not more than two (2)
separate processors, whether located in the same or different
computers.

Alternatively, for the Windows platform only, Licensee may
install and use the Programs on a single, designated, standalone
computer as described in Section 5.3 below. This Designated
Computer Installation Type is in lieu of the Standalone Named
User rights above, not in addition to those rights.

5.2. Network Concurrent User. The Programs may only be installed in
a central location on a single designated network server.
Licensee may have only as many Licensed Users simultaneously
operating a Program at any given time as the number of

Concurrent keys acquired for that Program, except in the case of
the Engine in which case the number of Program sessions running
at any one time is limited to the number of Engine workers
acquired. Portions of the Programs may be installed on
individual computers to accelerate startup times, as long as the
installations on the individual computers are controlled by the
license manager on the network server. Subject to the
foregoing, a Licensed User of the Concurrent License Option may
utilize any number of computers served by a single license
manager server provided that, before starting a Program session
on any computer, the Licensed User checks out a Concurrent Key
from the license manager server for that computer, and that any
simultaneous Program sessions on each computer are not run on
more than two (2) separate processors on each computer.
Licensees of the Concurrent License Option are prohibited from
providing Program access to users located outside the country in
which the license manager server is installed.

5.3. Designated Computer. The Programs may only be installed on a
single, designated, standalone, computer, provided the Programs
are only operated from that computer's console by only one
individual at any given time. This Installation Type is
intended to accommodate Program access from a single computer
shared by multiple users.
